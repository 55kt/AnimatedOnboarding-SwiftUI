## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **First Launch**  
   - App shows onboarding slides with animated content.  
   - User reviews features through **cards** and **slides**.  

2. **Final Slide**  
   - A **Continue button** opens the **Agreement sheet**.  
   - User must toggle acceptance of Terms & Privacy Policy.  

3. **Agreement Accepted**  
   - `hasAgreed` is saved in memory (can be persisted with `@AppStorage`).  
   - Onboarding flow is skipped on next launch.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- iOS 18+  
- Xcode 16+  
- Swift 5.9+

## âš¡ Notes
- Animations are handled via **async/await** delays to create smooth entry effects.  
- Onboarding flow is **non-dismissible** until the final slide, ensuring Terms acceptance.  
- Icons are powered by **SF Symbols** â€” replace them easily for your own branding.  
- Rules text in the agreement is stored in `AgreementSheetView`.
